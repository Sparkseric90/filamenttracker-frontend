**Filament Tracker**

For my 3d printing company, Sparks 3D Designs, I needed a way to find out exactly what I have on hand when I'm not
in my shop. With this app, I can view, add, edit, and delete inventory as needed. Can also store notes about each roll of
filament that I can view when I need to make changes on the fly when somethings not working correctly.
